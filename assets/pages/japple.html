                    On page 2, there is an ownership inscription of the esteemed and renowned righteous sage, Rabbi Mordechai [Marguliot-Schlezinger] Yafeh, "This Sefer belongs to the Torah scholar, the wonderful Rabbi Mordechai Yafeh, here in Vienna on the 24th day of the month of Sivan 1733."
                    
                    
                    <br>
                    The Gaon Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Lipshitz was the son of the Gaon Rabbi Eliezer Lipshitz, author of Heishiv Reb Eliezer & Damesek Eliezer. He was the brother of Rabbi Israel Lipshitz, who served as an Av Beit Din in Kleve, grandfather of the author of the "Tiferet Yisrael."
                    
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Lipshitz previously served as a rabbi in Poland before coming to Hungary. He came to gather signatures from over a hundred rabbis in order to permit the remarry. In 1770 Rabbi Benjamin Eisenstadt Rabbi of Lackenbach passed away & Rabbi Shlomo Zalman eulogized him, his eulogy deeply affected those in attendance. Soon after, he was appointed to fill his position as the rabbi, where he served for many years until his passing in 1808.
                    
                    
                    <br><br>
                    He is cited multiple times in the writings of Maran the Chatam Sofer. In the responsa collection "Chatam Sofer" on Even HaEzer, section 93, Rabbi Moses Sofer wrote, "On the condition that the great Rabbi Shlomo, Av Beit Din of the holy community of Lackenbach, also agrees with me."
                    
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    The Gaon Rabbi Yitzchak Itzik Frankel Bach [of the Chalfon family] (1776/1782-1835), foremost disciple of the Chatam Sofer. The son of Rabbi Uri Lipman and brother of Rabbi Sheraga Feivel Frankel, the Gaon of Göncruszka, and son-in-law of the Gaon Rabbi Yoav Av Beit Din of Abaújszántó (Santov). His teacher the Chatam Sofer was his matchmaker, recommending him to his father-in-law as one of his elite disciples. in 1810 he succeeded his father-in-law in Abaújszántó and from 1820 the Rabbi of Karaly (Carei).
                    
                    
                    <br>
                    His Father-in-law gave him a manuscript of his work Chen Tov and shortly after, the young son-in-law returned it with his work on the Sefer titled Zeved Tov. Both were published in 1806. While he was still serving as rabbi of Santov, his teacher commended him, in a responsum he wrote to the members of his community, regarding agunot: "…and their king and leader is my close disciple Rabbi Itzek, who apart from his ascetic righteousness and absolute uprightness, is also clearly an outstanding Torah scholar, especially on the topic of agunot, and he has already earnt renown through the sefer he composed on the laws of agunot…" (see: Kinstlicher, HaChatam Sofer VeTalmidav, pp. 247-250).
                    
                    
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    The esteemed and renowned sage & Mekubal, Rabbi Mordechai Marguliot Yaffe, was widely recognized and respected throughout the world for his wisdom and holiness. He was a disciple of the great Rabbi Avraham Brodie and stood by the side of Rabbi Yonatan Eibshutz during the famous dispute (as mentioned in "Torat HaKena'ut" page 91)
                    
                    
                    <br>
                    See also "Luachot HaEdut'' what he wrote concerning Rabbi Yonatan. There he is titled ''The Godly angel Rabbi Mordechai Marguliot Yaffe''.
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    
                    Rabbi Mordechai Margaliyot Yaffe was born in 1684 and passed away in 1755.
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    
                    His epitaph reads: "The marvelous and extraordinary rabbi who diligently exerted his hands; a great sage who worked diligently to weigh and measure in Torah. He was like one of the early sages, and he was set in a place to engage in deep analysis from every angle. A true head of knowledge, he was highly regarded everywhere, his name was prominent in gates of wisdom. He wore ten different garments (a reference to the books of his illustrious ancestor, Rabbi Mordechai Yaffe, author of "Levushim"). He toiled and rescued many souls and congregations from expulsions and various troubles (see Matzavot Vienna, number 17)."
                    
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    For more information about him, you can also refer to the "Kuntres Toldot Avot" at the end of the Sefer "Milei D'Avot."
                    
                    
                    <br>
                    Some of his descendants became notable families in Israel, including the family of Rabbi Israel David Marguliot -Yaffe-Shlezinger, who served as the Av Beit Din of Pezinok.
